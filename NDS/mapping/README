 Hello, folks. This is my workspace for Nintendo DS programming. Currently i'm studying how to
develop NDS games in order to build my first complete game, aMaze'ing Game. Wait for it. :)

  So, i'm mainly writing this README to register the tools that i'm using to develop. There is
 the tools specifications:
 
  - IDE: Eclipse; Version: Kepler Release; Build id: 20130614-0229;
  - Compiler: devKitArm binaries, building outside of eclipse with "make" and by hand;
  - S.O. Windows 7 Professional;
  - libraries: [msys] Version=1.0.17 [devkitARM]; Version=41; [libnds] Version=1.5.7.
  - NDS Emulator: DeSmuME 0.0.9;
  - Map editor: Mappy Win32 (but using a converter tool, made by myself, to translate the integer
  tiles array) in something that i can use.
  
  
  Finally, i believe that this is one of a few projects for this version of the libdns. All
  my basis were from older tutorials, and what i could build up was based on the own libdns
  documentation examples (plus what i've got from the basis =}).
  
  
  TODO list:
  
  PRIORITY:
  	- LOW: Do when there is nothing more to do (or the task is to cool to leave after);
  	- MEDIUM: Not the most priority, but is needed to be made; 
  	- HIGH: Do it first;
  	- LATER: Do when it's possible.
  
  - PRIO - DESC - STATE-
  +------+------+-------  
  
  Added: 09/11/2013
  - [HIGH] Add "take damage" cool down. [DONE]
  
  
  Added: 02/11/2013
  - [HIGH] Improve the triggering system. It is kind messy. Maybe implementing specific trigger objects will bring clarity [DONE].
   
  
  Added: 29/10/2013
  - [MEDIUM] Be able to process reactions by multiple interactions [DONE];
  - [HIGH] Add condition infrastructure for the trigger[reactions] executions [DONE - can be made through checking];
  - [LOW] Add running key (action/button) for the character [DONE - action button while moving makes the char sprint and will have precedence.];
  - [HIGH] Make walking do trigger actions [DONE];
  - [HIGH] Add static collision checking between character and objects [DONE].
  - [HIGH] Add GameObject destructor to delete triggers [DONE].
  - [HIGH] Add deactivate trigger from an object. The trigger is true and we want to be false [INVALID - this can be achieved with the change_reaction trigger].
  
  
  Added: 25/10/2013
  - [LOW] Fix the right side of the sewer map (the walls).
  - [HIGH] Make the GamePlay process the enqueued actions [DONE].
  
  Added: 24/10/2013
  - [MEDIUM] Get touchpad coordinates as moving directions [DONE].
  - [HIGH] Add relation ACTION<->TRIGGER to objects. [DONE]
   
  Added: 21/10/2013
  - Find pretty tiles to the sewer map (bridges and pipes were the water will flow) [DONE - but still ugly]
  
  Added: 20/10/2013

  - Draw the sewer map [DONE ~Thanks to Marta P)];
  - MEDIUM - Make the sewer map work with layer changes (so the water became animated);
  - Finish action touch. [DONE]
  - HIGH - Add invetory class [DONE];
  - HIGH - Add items IDs [DONE - currID, typeID];
  - HIGH - Add the lever item to the sewer map [DONE];
  - HIGH - Add more actions to the game [DONE];
  - HIGH - Add action "give item" to the lever item [DONE];
  - HIGH - Add actions IDs [DONE - changed the character_actions enum to game_actions];
  - LOW - Add openning scene to the game;
  - LOW - Add ending scene to the game;
  - LOW - Add game over screen;
  
  - Game initialization:
  	- LATER - Display splash;
  	- LATER - Display credits;
  	- LATER - Display main menu;
  - LOW - Add the darkness to the game...
  - LOW - Add sounds;
  - LOW - Add music.
  
  
  Added: 13/10/2013
  
  - LOW - Review all the work made this weekend [DONE];
  - MEDIUM - Repaint the game sprites with 256 colors [INVALID];
  - MEDIUM - Fix the Jack sprite. He step is to long and the walking effect is ugly [DONE];
  - LOW - Remake the torch sprite (smaller);
  - Finish the touch action [DONE].
  
  
  - First make the raw collision check [DONE]. Later, make the MapProcessor function return the tile type,
  that will enable different effects for the tiles [LATER]. Also will be good if the character walks 8px per
  tiles.. [DONE]
  
  - Add static collision. [OK]
  	- Improve map class; [DONE]
  	- make convToll read from files [DONE];
  	- Add static domain to character class  [NOPE].
  - Add GameMap class to Character constructor [INVALID - 'move character' now is a gameplay class issue].
  - Add level start/end calling (intro and exit "play scenes" functions) [TODO]
  
  Added: 24/09/2013
  - Add source codes instead of the compiled objects where is possible. [IN-PROGRESS..]
  - Add paging to the background to remove the ugly scrolling effects [DONE].
