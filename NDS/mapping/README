 Hello, folks. This is my workspace for Nintendo DS programming. Currently i'm studying how to
develop NDS games in order to build my first complete game, aMaze'ing Game. Wait for it. :)

  So, i'm mainly writing this README to register the tools that i'm using to develop. There is
 the tools specifications:
 
  - IDE: Eclipse; Version: Kepler Release; Build id: 20130614-0229;
  - Compiler: devKitArm binaries, building outside of eclipse with "make" and by hand;
  - S.O. Windows 7 Professional;
  - libraries: [msys] Version=1.0.17 [devkitARM]; Version=41; [libnds] Version=1.5.7.
  - NDS Emulator: DeSmuME 0.0.9;
  - Map editor: Mappy Win32 (but using a converter tool, made by myself, to translate the integer
  tiles array) in something that i can use.
  
  
  Finally, i believe that this is one of a few projects for this version of the libdns. All
  my basis were from older tutorials, and what i could build up was based on the own libdns
  documentation examples (plus what i've got from the basis =}).

  - Remade the GameMap class. I believe that there is some chunk in there and is needed to assemble
  the map static collision domain to it;
  - Add source codes instead of the compiled objects where is possible.
