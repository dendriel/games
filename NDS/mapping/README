 Hello, folks. This is my workspace for Nintendo DS programming. Currently i'm studying how to
develop NDS games in order to build my first complete game, aMaze'ing Game. Wait for it. :)

  So, i'm mainly writing this README to register the tools that i'm using to develop. There is
 the tools specifications:
 
  - IDE: Eclipse; Version: Kepler Release; Build id: 20130614-0229;
  - Compiler: devKitArm binaries, building outside of eclipse with "make" and by hand;
  - S.O. Windows 7 Professional;
  - libraries: [msys] Version=1.0.17 [devkitARM]; Version=41; [libnds] Version=1.5.7.
  - NDS Emulator: DeSmuME 0.0.9;
  - Map editor: Mappy Win32 (but using a converter tool, made by myself, to translate the integer
  tiles array) in something that i can use.
  
  
  Finally, i believe that this is one of a few projects for this version of the libdns. All
  my basis were from older tutorials, and what i could build up was based on the own libdns
  documentation examples (plus what i've got from the basis =}).
  
  
  TODO list:
  
  - First make the raw collision check. Later, make the MapProcessor function return the tile type,
  that will enable different effects for the tiles. Also will be good if the character walks 8px per
  tiles..
  
  - Add static collision.
  	- Improve map class;
  	- make convToll read from files (almost DONE);
  	- Add static domain to character class.
  - Add GameMap class to Character constructor.
  - Add level start/end calling (intro and exit "play scenes" functions)

  - Add source codes instead of the compiled objects where is possible.
  - Add paging to the background to remove the ugly scrolling effects [DONE].
