/**
 *  In order to collision checking an game element, it needs to be a collision element. Being
 * a collision element means that the element have it own collision area, that will be checked
 * with another collision areas/element from the game.
 *  To start the game is checking by static collision, that does not demand a lot of work, but
 * just demands that before moving the element ask if can go to the wanted position.
 * The st_rect will define a rectangle that represents the area of collision of the element. The
 * element, by his time, have his relative and absolute position in the game map. To collision
 * checking, will be necessary only the relative position. Checking against static collision is
 * to verify if the next tile 32x32 is blocked by something, however, the collision element don't
 * need to have a 32x32 rectangle area. It will have his rectangle of any size between 0,0-31,21
 * that will be checked in the GameMapProcessor. Take a look how it works:
 *
 *
 *
 * Game Tile 32x32 px.
 *
 * 0   4   8  12  16  20  24  28  31

 * |      +-----+
 * |    x,y1   x1,y1

 * +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---
 *
 * The square in the center is the st_rect that represents the collision area of an element. The collision
 * checking will be made........ TODO
 *
 *  Try to explain that each element is seen as being inside a tile (every time). But its sprite can not fulfill
 *  a tile, and the x,y; x1,y; x,y1; x1,y1 is the relative position of the element plus its rectangle size. The
 *  x, y of the rectangle tells the offset of the inside the tile.
 *
 *
 * Next, the x's represents the touching points of a collision element. The represented area will be the
 * "action collision area".
